\section{Introduction}
I am writing these notes to improve my understanding of this beautiful field.
These notes are based on ``Introduction to Smooth Manifolds'' by John Lee and ``Topology'' by James Munkres.

In one of his blog posts, Terrence Tao claims that to understand mathematics one needs to connect pre-rigorous understanding, i.e., intuitive computational understanding to theoretical or proof based understanding. So, throughout the notes, I will be connecting the two levels.

\section{Topology}

\subsection{Topological Spaces}

A topological space is defined as a pair consisting of a set $ X $ and a topology $ T $ on $ X $. Here, $ T $ simply means a collection of open subsets of $ X $.

This collection has the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The sets $ \emptyset $ and $ X $ are in $ T $ so they are open.
\item Given any subcollection of $ T $ the union is in $ T $ so it is open.
\item Given a finite subcollection in $ T $ the intersection is in $ T $ so it is open.
\end{enumerate}

Let $ U $ be in $ X $. $ U $ is an open set of $ X $ if it is in $ T $.
\subsection{Hausdorff Spaces}
A topological space is Hausdorff if there exists neighborhoods $ U_{1}, U_{2} $ of any two distinct pairs $ x_{1}, x_{2} $ that are disjoint.

If two sets are disjoint then $ A \cap B = \emptyset $, i.e., the sets do not share any elements in common.
\subsection{Basis and Countability}

Let $ X $ be a set. Then a basis $ B $ of $ X $ is a collection of subsets of $ X $ with the following
properties.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $ x \in X $ and $ S \in B $. Then $ x \in B $.
\item Let $ B_{1} \in B $. Let $ B_{2} \in B $. Then there exists  $ x \in B_{3} $ such that $ B_{3} \subset B_{1} \cup B_{2} $.
\end{enumerate}

We then can use $ B $ to generate a topology $ T $ as follows.

Let $ U \subset X $. Then $ U $ is open, i.e., $ U \in T $. Then  $ x \in B $ and $ B \subset U $ for any basis element in $ B $.

\subsection{Subspaces}

We can construct new topological spaces by taking subsets of existing ones, i.e., subspaces.

Let $ X $ be a topological space and $ S \subseteq X $ then a subspace topology on $ S $ is defined
by letting  $ U \subseteq  S $. Then the following statements are true.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $ U $ is open in $ S $ then for a open subset of $ V \subseteq X $, $ U =  V \cup  S $.
\item If for an open subset of $ V \subseteq X $, $ U =  V \cup  S $ then  $ U $ is open in $ S $.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Topological Manifolds}

Topological Manifolds are topological spaces with a given structure that makes behave like Euclidian space i.e., $ R^n $.

Essentially, this structure will allow calculus on smooth manifolds because it gives it a coordinate system.

If a topological space $ X $ is a topological manifold then the following statements are true.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $ X $ is a Hausdorff space.
\item $ X $ is second countable.
\item $ X $ looks locally like Euclidian.
\end{enumerate}

If a space $ X $ is second countable then $ X $ has a countable basis. If a space $ X $ has a countable basis then there exists a set $ B $ of neighborhood basis $ U_{i}, U_{i+1}, U_{n} $ for each point $ p \in U_{n} $ and each $ U_{n} $ contains at least one element of $ B $.

Here, `` $ U $ is neighborhood of x`` means that ``$ U $ is an open set containing $ x $.
